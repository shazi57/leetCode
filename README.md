# leetCode

### to run the tests
at root level, do

```
npm install
npm test
```

If you only want to use my test cases, 
just replace function body with your implementation and run the test.
All problems are located in the 'Problems' directory

```
const foo = function() {
  /* functionBody */
};

module.exports = foo;
```
